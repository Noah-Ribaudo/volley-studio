# Personas

## Coach Casey
**Role:** Club or high school volleyball coach

**Context:**
- Manages a team of 10-14 players
- Runs practices 2-3x per week, games 1-2x per week
- Has a set rotation strategy but needs to track it in real-time during games
- May adjust rotations mid-match based on matchups

**Goals:**
- Know exactly who should be where at any moment during a game
- Quickly reference rotations during timeouts or between points
- Plan and visualize rotations before games/practices
- Track score without losing track of rotation

**Pain points:**
- Paper rotation sheets get lost, wet, or hard to read
- Mental math for "we're in rotation 4, they just scored, so now we're..." is error-prone under pressure
- Existing apps are either too complex or too basic
