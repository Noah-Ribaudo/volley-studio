## Coach Casey - GameTime (Sideline)

**Core flow:**
- As a coach, I want to tap "we scored" or "they scored" so that the app tracks rotation for me
- As a coach, I want to see the current rotation at a glance so I can call out positions quickly
- As a coach, I want to undo a scoring mistake so I can correct errors without restarting

**Setup:**
- As a coach, I want to start a game with my saved team so I don't re-enter players each time
- As a coach, I want to set who serves first so rotation tracking starts correctly
- As a coach, I want to pick our starting rotation so the app knows where we began

**During game:**
- As a coach, I want to see who's serving so I can confirm we're in the right spot
- As a coach, I want to record substitutions so I know who's actually on the court
- As a coach, I want to see the score so I don't have to track it separately
- As a coach, I want to glance at my phone and immediately know the rotation without unlocking or navigating

**Post-game:**
- As a coach, I want to see game history/stats so I can review performance later

## Coach Casey - Whiteboard (Planning)

**Viewing:**
- As a coach, I want to see all 6 rotations so I can review our system
- As a coach, I want to step through phases of a rally so I can see player movement
- As a coach, I want to highlight a specific position so I can show a player their responsibilities

**Customizing:**
- As a coach, I want to drag players to custom positions so I can show our actual system (not textbook positions)
- As a coach, I want to save custom layouts so my adjustments persist
- As a coach, I want to show/hide the opponent's side so I can focus on just our team

**Team management:**
- As a coach, I want to assign players to positions so tokens show names not just "OH1"
- As a coach, I want to save multiple teams so I can switch between JV/Varsity or club teams
- As a coach, I want to share a team with assistant coaches so we're on the same page

## Player Pat - Whiteboard (Learning)

**Understanding rotations:**
- As a player, I want to see where my position goes in each rotation so I know my spots
- As a player, I want to step through a rally phase by phase so I understand movement
- As a player, I want to highlight my role so I can focus on just my position across rotations

**Self-study:**
- As a player, I want to access the whiteboard without coach involvement so I can study independently
- As a player, I want to see standard formations so I understand the basics before learning team-specific adjustments
